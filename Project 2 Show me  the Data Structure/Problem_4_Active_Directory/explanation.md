Problem 4: Active Directory
The best approach that came to mind in solving this preoblem set is recursion, so with every recursive call, I first stated the base case which is if user in the users array return True else rucursively go through all groups and search if user is in each group and if not found,  then return False

Efficiency

TIME COMPLEXITY
The time complexity is linear time complexity; O(N)

SPACE COMPLEXITY
Space Complexity is O(1) since we are not using any extra memory
