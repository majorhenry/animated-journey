Complexity of problems

P0: The time complexity is O(N) where N is the number of records between calls.csv and texts.csv
P1: The time complexity is O(N) where N is the number of records between calls.csv and texts.csv
P2: The time complexity is O(N). Where N is then number of records on calls.csv. As documented here: https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity
P3: The time complexity is O(NLogN). Where N is the number of records on calls.csv. The Sorting step takes O(N logN) as document here: http://bigocheatsheet.com/
P4:  The time complexity is O(NLogN). Where N is the number of records on calls.csv. The Sorting step takes O(N logN) as document here: http://bigocheatsheet.com/
