Problem 3: Rearrange Digits
In the solution to this problem set, I solved it after I noticed if the array is sorted and the digits are chosen by alternation, this gives the max possible combinations, hence I implemented merge sort and converted the digits to string so I can sum the digits like strings.

Efficiency

TIME COMPLEXITY
The time complexity of the meage sort is; O(NlogN), and iterating the array is linearly dependent to the size of the array; O(N).

SPACE COMPLEXITY
The space complexity is constant space as sorting was done inplace; O(1)
