Problem 2: Search in a Sorted Array
In the solution to this problem set, I solved it using Binary search, but first I used the mid pointer as an important reference point, to know if the mid element is a memeber of the left sorted portion of the array or a member of the right sorted portion of the input_list array,  this information gives insight on how to run the binary search to locate the target number as this could be located now with binary search

Efficiency

TIME COMPLEXITY
The time complexity is the same as that of a binary search algorithm which is; O(log N)

SPACE COMPLEXITY
The space complexity is constant space as no extra memory is used; O(1)
