Problem 6: Unsorted Integer Array
In the solution to this problem set, I solved it by iterating linearly throught the array to search for the min and max simultaneously, and this iteration was done once throught the array.

Efficiency

TIME COMPLEXITY
The time complexity is linearly dependent to the lenght of the array; O(N)

SPACE COMPLEXITY
The space complexity is constant space as no extra memory is used; O(1)
