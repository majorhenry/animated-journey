Problem 4: Dutch Flag Problem
In the solution to this problem set, I solved it using three pointers, the runner pointer is compared to the left most pointer or the right most pointer and the 0s are swapped to the left while the 2s are swapped to the right and this automatically leaves the 1s in the center.

Efficiency

TIME COMPLEXITY
The time complexity is linearly dependent to the size of the array; O(N)

SPACE COMPLEXITY
The space complexity is constant space as no extra memory is used; O(1)
